        Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. 
        Click on the links below to see the difference between a website with and without parallax scrolling.

      <h2>Section Two</h2>
      <p>
        Nature is the heart of the earth .Nature heals us .
        We have a strong bond and emotional connection with nature. 
        Things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies and much more are part of nature.
        Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Nature is often seen by humans as natural resources.
        We know that the natural environment provides us with a wide range of 'ecosystem services: all the things that people need and want that come from the natural world of which human beings are a part. We receive provisioning services food, fibre, energy, drinking water, building materials, natural medicine.
        The nature is beautiful, a blessing, fragile, helpful, important, comforting. 
        A mother is also beautiful, loving, caring, responsible, a gift from god, aspiring.
        The beauty of nature can have a profound effect upon our senses, those gateways from the outer world to the inner, whether it results in disbelief in its very existence as Emerson notes, or feelings such as awe, wonder, or amazement.Healthy ecosystems clean our water, purify our air, maintain our soil, regulate the climate, recycle nutrients and provide us with food. 
        They provide raw materials and resources for medicines and other purposes. They are at the foundation of all civilisation and sustain our economies.

        Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better” -Albert Einstein.
        My name is Davis Beckett, I am 11 years old and have always enjoyed spending time outside.
        From going on hikes with my family, to climbing the tree in our backyard or even swimming at the beach where my Grampa and Nana live.
        I just like being outside whenever and wherever I can!  The one thing I enjoy the most about nature though is being surrounded by the forest.  
        There is just something about how the forest surrounds me that makes me feel at home, it’s a peaceful and calm place that makes me happy.  
        I like to close my eyes and take it all in.  You can smell the moss on the trees, hear the sounds of a stream running close by and you can feel the forest floor beneath your feet.
        It’s comforting like a cozy blanket on a cold day.
